# Tool Library API

This project is a REST API for managing a tool library, built with Node.js and Express, supporting operations to list, search, add, update, and remove tools.


Live: <!-- your Render address, for example https://cpan212-lab2-jane-doe.onrender.com/api/tools -->

## Run it

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

The API runs at http://localhost:4000. Set `PORT` in `.env` to use a different port.

## Routes

| Method | Path | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/tools` | Every tool. `?category=garden` keeps only one category |
| GET | `/api/tools/:id` | One tool, or 404 |
| POST | `/api/tools` | Create a tool (201), or 400 with the invalid fields |
| PUT | `/api/tools/:id` | Replace a tool's fields (200), 400 or 404 |
| DELETE | `/api/tools/:id` | Remove a tool (204), or 404 |

## Testing

```bash
npm run check
```

This tries every route and prints which checks pass.
